## What is GCP?
Google Cloud Platform offers all the tools of the google cloud development environment to build your applications. It also offers free Gemini API Keys so you can leverage the full potential of generative AI during today's hacking!

These are some of the services the GCP offers ranging from backend & storage to scheduling and ML workloads. Some of them might be interesting to leverage during this case, especially the services enablign AI services! 

* **Vertex AI** : Train/host custom models, embeddings, batch prediction, Model Garden.
* **Vision API** : Labels, OCR, object detection.
* **Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech** : Voice features.
* **Translation API** : Multilingual apps fast.
* **Vertex AI Workbench** : Managed notebooks; GPUs/TPUs if available.

GCP offers a broad range of other services to allow for cloud deployment of applications. Feel free to check out the possibilities of GCP for your hacking today or future projects!

# ING Voice Assistant Hackathon 2025

## Overview
This repository contains synthetic banking data and website content chunks to support the development of an innovative voice-enabled assistant for ING Belgium customers. The goal is to create a solution that helps customers navigate banking services, find information, and initiate requests efficiently using natural language interaction.

## Project Objective
Create a voice-enabled assistant that:
- Guides customers through banking processes and requests
- Leverages customer data and banking information
- Supports Dutch (required), French and English (bonus)
- Provides natural, context-aware conversations
- Scales to handle various types of requests and data

## Dataset Structure

### 1. Banking Data
The repository includes synthetic banking data representing:

#### Customers (`customers.csv`)
- Customer demographics
- Segmentation (ADULT, CHILD, PROSPECT)
- Contact information
- Belgian context (addresses, names)

#### Products (`products.csv`)
- Various banking products (Current Account, Savings, Credit/Debit Cards, Loans)
- Product status tracking (Active, Blocked by ING, Blocked by Customer, Closed)
- Product-customer relationships

#### Transactions (`transactions.csv`)
- Comprehensive transaction history
- Transaction types (Credit, Debit)
- Realistic amounts and descriptions
- Date-based organization

### 2. Website Content
The `chunks` folder contains segmented content from ing.be:
- Organized by language (NL, FR, EN)
- One file per paragraph/section
- Covers banking processes and information

## Technical Requirements
