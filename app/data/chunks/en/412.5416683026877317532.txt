# Why my credit card is not working? - ING Belgium - Why is your credit card not working or blocked?

## Do you have any issue with your PIN code?

### View or receive the PIN code of a new credit card

When you receive your new card, you can view your PIN code in the ING Banking app.
If you receive a new card after the previous one has been blocked or if this is your first card, you can also request a new PIN code by text message ( activate your new ING credit card ).
If you receive a new card after replacing a defective card or renewing a card that will expire (soon), your PIN will remain the same.
You don't have a mobile phone or have you missed the SMS application deadline? Your PIN code will be sent to you by post.
To ensure it is sent to the correct address, please check that we have your correct address in our systems:
* in the ING Banking app via Services > Personal details > Legal address or Postal address
* in Homeâ€™Bank via you profile at the top right of the screen > Personal details > Legal address or Postal address

### You entered 3 times a wrong PIN code

**After 3 tentatives of a wrong PIN code, you credit card is blocked.**
View your pin in the ING Banking app! This will deblock your credit card.

### Your card reader is not accepting your new PIN

If you are using a card you have just received, activate it before using it for payments via the card reader.
Use your new card **for the first time** by performing an action **with the PIN code** : a purchase at a merchant, a cash withdrawal (note: a withdrawal usually involves a fee) or a change of your PIN code at an ATM.
Your ING credit card **is then activated** ! The old replaced card is automatically deactivated when the new one is activated.
However, we recommend that you destroy it by cutting it in half at the level of the chip.
**Please note** : the card cannot be activated through contactless transactions.
