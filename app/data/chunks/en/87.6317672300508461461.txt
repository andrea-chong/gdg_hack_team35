# Activate your new ING credit card - ING Belgium

## 4. Use your PIN to activate your ING credit card and the contactless feature

Your credit card and the contactless feature will be **automatically activated** the **first time** you use it, provided you use it to perform an action that requires entering your **PIN** **(** a payment in a shop, a cash withdrawal or a PIN change).
Your old card is automatically deactivated as soon as your new card becomes active. Nevertheless, we recommend destroying your old card by cutting both it and the chip in half.
Please note that contactless transactions do not enable the card to be activated.
