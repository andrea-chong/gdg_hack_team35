themselves, their family or close personal relationships.

campaign, including participation in the campaign and the awarding of the credit transfer. Subject to the same
reservation, neither ING nor the aforementioned persons can be held liable for any technical problem occurring during

circumstances which may make it impossible to continue running the campaign. ING may suspend or end the
campaign on an individual or campaign-wide basis.
18. All participants will lose their right to a credit transfer if it becomes apparent that deceptive practices were used, in
whatever form, or if illegal agreements were made in bad faith between participants to influence their chances of
