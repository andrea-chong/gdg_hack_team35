When does the cover start and when does it end? The cover starts for the new ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack), from the opening of the account when the insurance cover is included in the account or for the existing ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack), from the date communicated to the account holder when the insurance cover is included in the ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack). All cover terminates immediately and expires automatically in the event of non-renewal or withdrawal from the ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack) or if the present insurance/guarantee contract between ING and AIG is terminated for any reason whatsoever. If the group contract is terminated for any reason whatsoever, no further cover will be granted to the holder of an ING Green Account (with the ING Do More pack). By way of example, this means that: for purchase insurance, no additional cover will be granted after termination, even if the items were purchased before the cover was terminated and for ticket cancellation insurance, no additional cover will be granted after termination, even if the tickets were purchased before the cover was terminated.
