## FAQ

### What technology is used to make secure payments?

NFC (Near Field Communication) technology ensures the secure exchange of data. NFC only works within a radius of about 5 centimeters. You have to hold your device close to the terminal to exchange data. In addition, you always have to confirm your payment with fingerprint, facial recognition or unlock code.
