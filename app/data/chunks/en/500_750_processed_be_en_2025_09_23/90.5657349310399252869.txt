## ING offers 4 options to make each online payment quickly, simply and securely

* **Payment using the ING Card, Visa Classic, Visa Gold and MasterCard Gold credit cards** : All ING credit cards are protected by MasterCard® Id Check™ and Verified by Visa. When you make a payment online in Belgium or abroad, check whether both these logos are present on the site, so as to ensure that your transaction is 100% secure.
**Do you not have a credit card?** Compare our credit cards **and apply for your card right away!**
* **Payment using the Maestro or Bancontact function of your debit card** : You can pay on all Belgian and international sites displaying the Maestro® or Bancontact logos. Via your ING Card Reader you are identified every time you pay, which further enhances your security.
* **Payment via Home'Pay** : pay directly via your Home’Bank secure connection for every online payment on sites displaying the Home'Pay logo. To use Home'Pay, all you need is an ING current account and a Home'Bank subscription. **If you do not yet have access to Home'Bank** apply for Home'Bank online .
* **Pay via itsme** : when you choose the itsme option, you will be asked to open the itsme app on your mobile phone and confirm the transaction with touch ID, face ID or your 5-digit itsme code. To install itsme or link it to ING, see itsme page .
* Use your ING Card Reader for online payments via your credit cards, via the Maestro or Bancontact function of your debit card or via Home’Pay. You will then sign each transaction in the same way as your Home'Bank transactions.
