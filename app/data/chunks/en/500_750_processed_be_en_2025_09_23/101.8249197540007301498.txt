### What are the payment, transfer and withdrawal limits ?

**For small purchases below 50 euros** , it is possible to make payments without entering your PIN.
After making a total 100 euros of payments without entering your PIN, you will have to confirm any subsequent payments with your PIN before you can make payments again without entering your PIN.

Use your ING debit card to make payments in Belgium, abroad and online or to withdraw cash at any ATM displaying the Bancontact-, Maestro- or Mastercard- logo. **You can also use your card to make payments and withdrawals all over the world.**
Caution ! However, there is no 100% guarantee that the debit card will be accepted everywhere. For example, some ATMs do not accept Maestro/Mastercard in Indonesia, Malaysia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, USA and Japan.
