## Are you expecting a new credit card?

Have you applied for a new card? Did you request a replacement of your credit card because it was unreadable? Or after it was lost or stolen?
Just follow the next steps and your credit card will be ready to use.

## 1. You are informed by text message of the arrival of your new credit card

We send a text message to the mobile phone number we have on file for you as soon as your new card is on its way.

## 2. You receive your credit card by post

You receive your new card by post within 3 to 5 working days of this text message. We use the postal address we already have for you on file. You can check this address via the ING Banking-app or via Home'Bank under "My settings".

## 3. Check or request your PIN

If you are receiving a duplicate or replacement card after your old one expired or stopped working, you can continue using the same PIN.
If you are applying for a new credit card or your card was lost or stolen, you can
* either check your PIN in the ING Banking-app > Services > Cards > Pincode > Check
* or request the new PIN to be sent by text message. Follow the instructions provided in the letter sent with your card. Make sure you use the mobile phone number you gave us. You can check this address in the ING Banking-app > Services > Personal data or in Home'Bank under "My Settings".
You have 12 days to request your PIN. After this period or if you do not have a mobile phone, the new PIN is sent by post to the same address as your card.
Once you have received your new PIN, you can change it via any Bancontact CASH point .
