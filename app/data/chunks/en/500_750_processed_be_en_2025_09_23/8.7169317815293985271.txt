# Joint accounts - ING Belgium

## Pro tip: Try the hybrid approach!

In addition to a joint account, you can of course always keep your personal account(s). Many couples opt for a hybrid approach. Their salary/income is paid into their respective personal accounts. A direct debit is set up to transfer an agreed amount into a joint account each month to cover mutual expenses. Having both a joint bank account and individual bank accounts can help equal out the expenses making spending a little more equal depending on each person's income.
Whatever your decision, the most important thing is to be on the same wavelength with your partner or flatmates from the outset.
