\*New: ING has chosen to offer debit cards using the Bancontact and Mastercard network. This gives you, among other, a greater accessibility for your online and in-store payments in Belgium and abroad. All existing debit cards will be gradually and automatically replaced by the new ING debit card in 2024 and 2025. So you don't have to apply for it yourself. Below you will find more information as well as a video explaining the new ING debit card.

## Maestro or Mastercard: what is the difference?

You probably already know the Mastercard name and logo from credit cards... But now ING is launching a debit card that uses the Mastercard network, which is more extensive than the Maestro network. This means you can pay more easily online and in more shops around the world.
**What are the advantages of the new ING debit card ?**
- You can pay in more shops (as well online) in Belgium and abroad, wherever the Bancontact and/or Mastercard logo is visible.
- You benefit from extra security for your online payments thanks to the ease of use of itsmeÂ® and the CVC code on the back of the card. The CVC code should be considered as private as your card number.
- It's easy to book a car or hotel. Please note that the amount reserved will be blocked on your ING current account and released once your transaction has been completed.
What to do to get your new debit card? You don't have to do a thing! You will automatically receive the card in 2024 or 2025. All debit cards will be replaced and you will be notified by a text message, a message in your ING Banking app/Home'Bank or an e-mail once your card has been sent. After this notification, all you have to do is to keep an eye on your mailbox and activate the card once received.
