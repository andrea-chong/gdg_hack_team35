## Frequently asked questions

### I don’t have a foreign currency account. Can I still order or deposit foreign currency?

Unfortunately, that’s not possible. At the moment, we’re no longer opening new foreign currency accounts. We understand this may not be ideal, but we’re happy to work with you to find a suitable alternative.
