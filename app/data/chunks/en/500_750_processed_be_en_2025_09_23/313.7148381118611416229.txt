## About Apple Pay

* ### Simple
No need for a PIN code when paying, you confirm your identity with Face ID (facial recognition) or Touch ID (fingerprint).
* ### Secure
Apple Pay uses a specific number linked to your device and a unique transaction code. Your debit card or credit card number is never stored on your device or on Apple's servers, nor is it shared with merchants.
* ### Convenient
For in-store payments, most payment terminalsÂ¹ accept contactless payment so all you need to do is present your iPhone/Apple Watch. For online or in-app payments, simply choose the Apple Pay option1 from your iPhone/iPad. In addition, payments of more than 50 euros contactless are accepted!
