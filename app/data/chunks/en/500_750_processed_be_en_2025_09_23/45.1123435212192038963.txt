## Frequently asked questions

### What should I do if I transferred money to the wrong account number?

If you don't know the beneficiary, we can request the return of funds from the beneficiary's bank. There is a charge for the service. Contact us via the service section to request a return of funds.

### The sender claims to have transferred money, but I donâ€™t see it in my account yet?
