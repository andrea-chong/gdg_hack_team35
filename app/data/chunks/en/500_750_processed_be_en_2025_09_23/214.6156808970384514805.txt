The **fidelity premium** is only earned on amounts that have remained uninterruptedly in the regulated savings account for 12 months starting on the day after the deposit. The rate of the fidelity premium in force at the time of payment or the start of a new period remains unaltered for a period of 12 months. Fidelity premiums that have already been earned are paid into your account on the first day following the quarter in which they were earned or when you close your account.
The **base rate** accrues from the day after the money is deposited to the account until the day on which it is withdrawn. The base rate is paid into your account on the value date of January 1 or when you close the account.
Interest rates are gross and expressed on an annual basis and may be adjusted at any time. You can find the current rate online and at any ING branch. If the rate changes, we inform account holders on their account statements.
