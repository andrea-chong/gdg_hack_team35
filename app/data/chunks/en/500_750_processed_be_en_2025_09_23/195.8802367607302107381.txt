### What is the difference between the ING QR Code and itsme®?

They are both ways of identifying yourself and signing payments. The ING QR code is exclusively for doing your banking as an ING customer. Itsme®, on the other hand, has other applications, such as logging into your profiles on government websites, etc.
When you use the QR code to sign a payment, you get to see more information about the payment than when you use itsme®. This is important to guard against phishing. The more information you see, the easier it is to tell if something is not right.
