# When should you give your child a bank card? - ING Belgium - What is the best age to give your child a bank card?

Reading time: 3 min 24 July 2024 Giving your child a bank card can be a pivotal step in teaching them financial responsibility.
A kids’ debit card offers a practical way for young people to learn about managing money, budgeting, and making informed spending decisions. Under your guidance, a kids’ bank card allows your child to gain real-world experience, helping to foster a sense of independence and confidence. And, with the right oversight and tools, parents can ensure their child uses their bank card responsibly and safely.

## At what age can a child have a bank card?

In Belgium, there is no clear legal minimum age for having a bankcard. Each bank sets its own rules.
For example, at ING, the youth account, with a debit card, is available from the age of 10.

## How do you know if your child is ready for a debit card?

There is no precise ideal age, as maturity varies from one child to the next. And, as a parent you might get a good, or not so good, surprise at your child's attitude to money.
Are you wondering whether your child is ready to have their own bank card? Certain factors can guide your choice, such as :
* impulsivity: does your child tend to be impulsive?
* the concept of money: does your child already know about saving and/or budgeting? Does your child know the value of money?
* the relationship with money: how does your child behave with pocket money or birthday money, for example?
Consider the answers just as indicators and no more. In your specific case, you may want and/or need other criteria to help you decide. The important thing is to ask yourself the right questions, the ones that are right for you and your child.
