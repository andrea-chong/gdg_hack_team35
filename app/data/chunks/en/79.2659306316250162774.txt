## Frequently Asked Questions

### I’m having trouble entering verification codes. What do I do?

Verification codes can only be used once and are only valid for a few minutes. After that time passes, you need to request another code. When you request to resend a code, any previous code is invalid. If this doesn’t resolve the issue, please try again later.

### I’m not receiving verification codes. What do I do?

If you do not receive a verification code, confirm the email address and mobile number are correct in Mastercard Click to Pay. You can also request to resend a code or send a code through email or SMS instead.
If your issue isn’t resolved, you can check out without using Click to Pay and manually enter your payment information.

### What happens when I select “remember me”?

Choosing “Remember me” gives you faster access to your cards. You’ll be recognized and will not need a verification code to access your cards the next time you check out with Mastercard Click to Pay on the same device and browser.

### How do I delete a remembered device?

Sign in to Mastercard Click to Pay to manage your settings, like viewing and deleting your remembered devices and browsers.
