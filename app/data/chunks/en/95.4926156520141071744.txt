# Open your ING Do Basic pack with current account - ING Belgium - ING Belgium - The basic bank account pack

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Need a joint bank account?

It is possible to open an ING Do Basic Pack for two account holders. You can add a second holder to your pack for an additional **€1.00 per month.**
If you are both between 18 and 25 years old, the fee for the pack will not be charged. You only pay this second holder fee.
Once one of the holders turns 26 the monthly flat fee will be charged together with the second holder fee (€1,90 + 1,00 per month).
Prefer a banking pack where the additional account holder is included in the monthly fee? Choose an ING Do More banking pack.

### Do I need a business current account if I am a self-employed or a legal entity?

It is more efficient if your personal and professional payment transactions are separated:
• Professional account fees are tax deductible;
• It is easier for your accountant to justify each transaction;
• If you do not have a professional account for your business, the tax inspector will examine the private account you use professionally.
