# Traveling abroad with ING. Everything you need to know - ING Belgium - Traveling Abroad? ING has you covered

## Using your ING card abroad

Within Europe Your ING debit card is automatically active for use within the eurozone. You can easily pay in shops, restaurants, and withdraw cash from ATMs displaying the Bancontact, Maestro, or Mastercard logo, depending on your card type.
Outside Europe ING now issues debit cards that work on the Mastercard network. Thuis means that these cards are ready to use worldwide and no activation needed.
ðŸ‘‰ Important:
* **Still using an older Maestro card?**
Youâ€™ll need to activate it first via the ING Banking app or Homeâ€™Bank before using it outside Europe.
* **Already have a Mastercard debit card?**
You're good to go! Just make sure international payments are enabled in your app settings.

### Withdraw cash abroad

You can withdraw money at ATMs that show the Maestro, Visa, or Mastercard logo, depending on your card.
Just keep in mind:
* The **ATM provider may charge additional fees** .
* **Exchange rate margins** may apply if you're withdrawing in a currency other than the euro.
